         <h1>What does Vault Pro have to offer you?</h1>
         <p>Well let's look at a few of the great opportunities you get with Vault Pro. </p>
         <hr>
    </div>
    <div id="optionOne"> <!-- The beginning of the first option box -->
        <h3>It's Free</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>First off let me start with one of the best features, this site is completely free. Once you sign up for your free account
        you will have access to all the features Vault Pro has to offer. There are no tiers or gimmicks.  </p>
    </div>
    <div id="optionTwo"> <!-- Beginning of the second option box -->
        <h3>Upload Your Projects</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>You can upload your projects to your account on Vault Pro anytime, from anywhere. There is no limit to how many projects
        that you can upload to your account to manage. If you have a project that you don't want in your account anymore you have the
        option to delete it from your account with the click of a button. </p>
    </div>
    <div id="optionThree"> <!-- Beginning of the third option box -->
        <h3>Edit Your Projects</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>This feature has to be one of my favorites because you can edit your project from anywhere at anytime. How great is that?
        Say you're out away from home and you aren't near your computer and you come up with a genius idea and you want to add it to your project.
        Do you have to go home? Nope all you need is a computer that you can access Vault Pro from and you will then be able to add that great idea to your
        project. </p>
    </div>
    <div id="whyWait"> <!-- Beginning of the fourth information box -->
